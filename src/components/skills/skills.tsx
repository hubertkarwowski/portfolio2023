                            Since the very beginning, Iâ€™ve done remote work for agencies, consulted
                            for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create web
                            products for both business and consumer use.

                            I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and
                            built with best practices. The main area of my expertise is front-end
                            development with React.
